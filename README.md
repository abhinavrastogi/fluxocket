# fluxocket

A drop-in replacement for the Facebook Dispatcher, which keeps all clients connected to one server in sync by passing all actions and their payload over a socket. Simple as that!

See demo at https://github.com/abhinavrastogi/fluxocket-chat and see it running at http://fluxocket-chat.herokuapp.com/!
